# Maze_gen_and_solver

Maze_gen_and_solver is a C++ application that generates and solves mazes. 
It generates a maze using a Prim's algorithm, and saves it to a text file.
Next, it reads a maze from a text file, finds the shortest path from the start to the end using A* search algorithm,
and outputs the solution.

## Features

- Generates mazes using a Prim's algorithm.
- Saves mazes to text files.
- Reads mazes from text files.
- Finds the shortest path from the start to the end of the maze using A* search algorithm.
- Outputs the solution to the console.
